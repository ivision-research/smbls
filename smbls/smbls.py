IIS uses an actual account--by default, IUSR_ComputerName, for anonymous access to resources on a website. Strictly speaking, such access isn't anonymous, because the security principal is known even though unidentified people are using the account. IUSR_ComputerName (or whatever you name the account) has a password, and IIS signs in to the account when the service starts. As a result, the IIS "anonymous" user is a member of Authenticated Users but Anonymous Logon isn't.

In Windows and Windows Server operating systems, a software restriction policy can assign one of three security levels to code: Unrestricted Restricted Disallowed When code runs at the restricted security level, the Restricted SID is added to the user's access token.

System is a hidden member of Administrators. That is, any process running as System has the SID for the built-in Administrators group in its access token. When a process that's running locally as System accesses network resources, it does so by using the computer's domain identity.

Services running as NetworkService access local resources as ordinary users and access network resources by using the computer's identity. As a result, a service that runs as NetworkService has the same network access as a service that runs as LocalSystem, but it has significantly reduced local access.

The Administrator account is the first account created during operating system installation. The account can't be deleted, disabled, or locked out, but it can be renamed. By default, the Administrator account is a member of the Administrators group, and it can't be removed from that group.

By default, Guest is a member of the Everyone and the Guests groups. The domain Guest account is also a member of the Domain Guests and Domain Users groups. Unlike Anonymous Logon, Guest is a real account, and it can be used to sign in interactively. The Guest account doesn't require a password, but it can have one.

By default, the Domain Admins group is a member of the Administrators group on all computers that have joined the domain, including domain controllers. Domain Admins is the default owner of any object that's created in the domain's Active Directory by any member of the group. If members of the group create other objects, such as files, the default owner is the Administrators group.

By default, the only member of the group is the Administrator account for the forest root domain.

It's a universal group if the domain is in native mode, and it's a global group if the domain is in mixed mode. The Enterprise Admins group is authorized to make changes to the forest infrastructure, such as adding child domains, configuring sites, authorizing DHCP servers, and installing enterprise certification authorities. By default, the only member of Enterprise Admins is the Administrator account for the forest root domain. The group is a default member of every Domain Admins group in the forest.

By default, the only member of the group is Administrator. Objects that are created by members of Group Policy Creator Owners are owned by the individual user who creates them. In this way, the Group Policy Creator Owners group is unlike other administrative groups (such as Administrators and Domain Admins). Objects that are created by members of these groups are owned by the group rather than by the individual.

    Modified impacket.smbconnection.SMBConnection.connectTree that returns MaximalAccess field.

    Changes:
    - Return (TreeID, MaximalAccess)
